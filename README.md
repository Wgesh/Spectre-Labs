# Spectre Labs
This is my final project for my Game Programming class. You can check out the full game as an `.exe` file in the `dist` [folder](./dist/). Please excuse the nondescriptive commit messages, I did not originally use GitHub for this project (to check a summary of what I did in each version refer to the [Game Programming Journal](./other/Game%20Programming%20Journal.pdf) file).
